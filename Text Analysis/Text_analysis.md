I tried visualization using the voyant csv file <br>

I tried two tools - MALLET and WordCounter for Text Visualization.

I did this on Wordcounter, and found it more similar to voyant in terms of use and results. The analysis showed multiple graph trypes that were auto-generated, and showed that there was a lot of data that would have to be eliminated if one needs to analyze the content. Although, I found the voyant analysis more robust, and I had much more control over the data and the visualization for every attribute in voyant, which I couldn't in this tool. Further, I still couldn't overcome the word id challenge.

This tool (MALLLET - web version) was less efficient than voyant for me, and whule the co-relation was interactive, there was little I could deduce from the graph. <br>
