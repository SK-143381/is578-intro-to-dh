Theoretical Tool - (I could not find how to apply this in Unity)
Name of the Tool:  Scholarly 3D Toolkit
Link to the Tool: https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/2111
Description: This tool can help modulate details about events and monuments into 3D environments by adding metadata, which I found really interesting. I do not any experience using the tool, and my knowledge about it is limited to the textual description on the weblink and a video posted on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtW29vqyJcM about this work as explained by the author. This is a 'DH Tool' because of its ability to represent cultural data (mined from ancient texts) to a spatial environment for easy visualization.

Name of the Tool: Neatline
Link to the Tool: https://dh-abstracts.library.virginia.edu/works/1932
Description: This tool helps visualize stories happening in texts in representations on media such as maps and photogrpahs. It is a DH Tool, because it can be applied to visualize data in a large range of contexts from places and events to objects and timelines. I do not have experience using this tool, or the Omeka software it is a plug-in for, but I wish to explore it.
